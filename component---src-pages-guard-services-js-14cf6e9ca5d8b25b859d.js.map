Trained security personnel\r\n            can monitor the premises, identify potential security threats, and\r\n            take proactive measures to prevent incidents from occurring. They\r\n            can also assist with crowd control during busy periods, handle\r\n            difficult situations with unruly customers, and provide a sense of\r\n            safety and security for both customers and employees. Investing in\r\n            security services can not only help prevent losses due to theft or\r\n            vandalism but also improve the overall customer experience and\r\n            increase business reputation.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default GuardServices;"],"names":["GuardServices","React","Layout","id","className","src","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
